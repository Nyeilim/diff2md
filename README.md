Find the differences between two texts and output the corrected text with Markdown

The code is used for correcting my dictation of English listening materials. So there's some special feature between the sample text and dictation(origin) text.
1. Two texts will have the same number of lines.
2. The text maybe lacks a lot. Forgive my poor English~ ðŸ˜‚
3. The text usually contains multiple lines and split with '\n\n'.

And the program will do some preprocessing to the text for ignoring some unimportant mistake.
1. Ignore case. That means 'The' and 'the' will be recognized the same text.
2. Ignore punctuation. That means 'day.' and 'day' will be recognized the same text.

To prepare for eventually sending astronauts to Mars, NASA began taking applications Friday for four people to live for a year in Mars Dune Alpha.

That's a 1,700-square-foot Martian habitat inside a building in Houston.

The paid volunteers will work in environment similar to Mars.

They will have limited communications with family, restricted food and resources.

NASA is planning three experiments with the first one starting in the fall next year.

Food will all be ready-to-eat space food.

Some plants will be grown, but not potatoes like in the movie "The Martian".

"We want to understand how humans perform in them," said lead scientist Grace Douglas. "We're looking at Mars realistic situations."

The application process opened Friday and they're not seeking just anybody.
