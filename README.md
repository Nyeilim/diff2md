Find the differences between two texts and output the corrected text with Markdown

The code is used for correcting my dictation of English listening materials. So there's some special feature between the right text and dictation text.
1. Two texts will have the same number of lines.
2. The text maybe lacks a lot. Forgive my poor English~ ðŸ˜‚
